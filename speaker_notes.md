“These two public events — La Nuit des Chercheurs and La Fête de la Science — are major opportunities for scientists to engage directly with the public.
Usually, researchers stand next to posters or interactive displays to start conversations about their work.

But this time, we decided to take it one step further — to actually collect experimental data from visitors.
Behavioral economics often relies on student samples, and we saw these events as a unique chance to test our ideas with a much more diverse population: children, parents, retirees, entire families.

The 2024 edition of La Fête de la Science was themed “Océan de savoir” — Ocean of Knowledge — which inspired us to design a game about resource sharing and sustainability.

Interestingly, visitors arrived at our stand one group after another, just like successive generations. So the structure of the event itself perfectly matched our research question:
how do generations cooperate when sharing a common resource?”


<!-- _notes: -->
Here I want to make the transition from classical CPRs — where people interact within the same generation — to intergenerational CPRs, where time itself creates the social dilemma.

The key point: future generations cannot negotiate or react.  
So the usual mechanisms that sustain cooperation, like reciprocity or punishment, no longer apply.

This makes intergenerational cooperation one of the hardest and most fascinating social dilemmas to study.
